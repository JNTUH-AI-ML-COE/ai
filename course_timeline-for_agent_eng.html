                    <strong>What Are LLM Agents?</strong> – Define LLM-based agents as systems where an LLM autonomously decides actions to accomplish goals, using reasoning and tools. Introduce the spectrum of <em>agenticity</em>, from simple prompt-driven apps to fully autonomous agents. Discuss how real-world AI applications often lie in between, with limited autonomy balanced by deterministic workflows and human oversight.

                    <strong>Agent Design Patterns Overview:</strong> Survey the <em>seven core design patterns</em> for agentic systems. Explain <strong>Controlled Flows</strong> (LLMs operate within a fixed step sequence) and <strong>LLM-as-a-Router</strong> (LLM routes requests to different workflows) as low-autonomy patterns. Contrast these with higher-autonomy patterns: <strong>Parallelization</strong> (multiple LLMs tackling subtasks in parallel), <strong>Reflect-and-Critique</strong> (one LLM generates, another evaluates in a feedback loop), <strong>Human-in-the-Loop</strong> (human checkpoints in the agent pipeline), <strong>Autonomous Agents</strong> (single agent with tool use planning its own steps), and <strong>Multi-Agent Systems</strong> (multiple agents collaborating under various architectures). Emphasize when to use each pattern and the trade-offs (complexity vs. reliability).

                <li>
                    <span class="time-block">01:00 – 01:30</span>
                    <strong>Examples and Use Cases:</strong> Provide real-world examples of each pattern. E.g., <em>Controlled Flow</em>: content review pipelines with fixed stages; <em>LLM Router</em>: triaging customer queries to different departments; <em>Parallelization</em>: using multiple LLMs to generate and evaluate code solutions concurrently. For <em>Reflect-and-Critique</em>, discuss iterative refinement of a report by generator and evaluator agents. Highlight how <em>Human-in-the-Loop</em> is essential for sensitive domains (e.g. AI suggesting decisions with a human final approval). Reinforce that <em>Agents</em> (pattern 6) plan sequences with tools for open-ended tasks (like iterative software development), and <em>Multi-Agent</em> setups enable tackling very complex problems (e.g. agents specialized in different roles collaborating on scientific discovery).

                <li>
                    <span class="time-block">01:30 – 02:00</span>
                    <strong>Knowledge Updatability and Consistency:</strong> Discuss how to ensure an agent's knowledge remains consistent and updated. If the underlying LLM is static, one must carefully manage the retrieved info. Outline challenges like knowledge conflicts (LLM's training data vs. retrieved data) – the agent might have to be instructed to defer to retrieved current data. Talk about <em>tool-aided knowledge</em>: e.g., using a web search tool for real-time info is a form of retrieval too. Also mention emerging ideas like fine-tuning or learning to retain new info (some research on LLMs that can update their weights or use scratchpad memory). While we won't fine-tune in this course, understanding that agents often need an external knowledge source to overcome the closed-world limitation of LLMs is key.

                <li>
                    <span class="time-block">02:00 – 02:30</span>
                    <strong>Case: Q&A Agent with RAG:</strong> Present a concrete scenario such as a <em>customer support agent</em> that uses a product documentation knowledge base. Walk through how a user question triggers a retrieval of relevant articles and how the agent incorporates that into its answer (maybe show an example prompt with retrieved text snippets included). Highlight how the agent's response cites or at least uses the data (pointing out that blindly relying on LLM's memory could lead to hallucinations – retrieved data grounds it in truth). Show how performance improves when enabling retrieval: for instance, the agent correctly answers a question about a new feature that the base LLM (without retrieval) would have hallucinated on.

                    <span class="time-block">02:30 – 03:00</span>
                    <strong>Personalization and Contextualization:</strong> Extend the concept of memory to personalization – agents tailoring responses based on user-specific data. For example, an agent that knows a user's profile (preferences, past behavior) can retrieve those from a database to personalize recommendations. This involves storing user data embeddings and treating that as part of context. Connect this to <em>human-agent interaction</em>: a more personalized agent feels more like an assistant than a generic model. Conclude the lecture by summarizing: robust agents need to manage external knowledge and context explicitly, using retrieval and memory systems, because we can't expect a single LLM prompt to carry <em>all</em> relevant info for complex tasks.

                <li>
                    <span class="time-block">00:00 – 00:30</span>
                    <strong>Advanced Prompting Fundamentals:</strong> Review prompt engineering basics quickly (instruction vs. few-shot prompts, role prompting) then extend into <strong>advanced techniques crucial for agents</strong>. Discuss how <em>prompt quality</em> dictates agent behavior. Cover <em>role assignment</em> (using system prompts to define the agent's persona or expertise), <em>contextual prompts</em> (providing tools' documentation or API specs in the prompt when the agent uses tools), and <em>few-shot prompting</em> to guide the agent's reasoning format. Emphasize the importance of <strong>deterministic formatting</strong> in agent prompts – for example, instructing the LLM to follow a specific output schema so the agent's parser can read the action (e.g., JSON or &lt;tool&gt;&lt;/tool&gt; tags).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="time-block">00:30 – 01:00</span>
                    <strong>Chain-of-Thought Prompting:</strong> Dive into the <em>Chain-of-Thought (CoT)</em> technique where the LLM is prompted to "think step-by-step" before final answers. Explain how CoT improves complex reasoning by having the model generate intermediate reasoning steps. Show examples of CoT prompts versus normal prompts, and how CoT can be used within an agent to have it reason about which tool to use next. Mention research that LLMs with CoT can solve tasks that require multi-step reasoning which they otherwise fail. Connect CoT to agent design: many agent frameworks internally use a CoT-style scratchpad for the model to propose an action and reason about it.

                <li>
                    <span class="time-block">01:00 – 01:30</span>
                    <strong>Self-Ask and Decomposition Techniques:</strong> Present prompting techniques that break down complex queries. <em>Self-ask prompting</em> teaches the model to pose sub-questions to itself, then answer them, which can be a precursor to using tools (e.g., "What do I need to do first? Now solve that…"). Similarly, <em>Task decomposition prompts</em> instruct the LLM to list steps or plans before execution. These are design patterns to make the agent's plan explicit. Provide a guided example: given a complex user request, show how an agent might first respond with a plan (in natural language or a structured format) before execution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="time-block">01:30 – 02:00</span>
                    <strong>Prompt Patterns for Reliability:</strong> Cover prompt patterns that improve reliability and controllability of agent outputs. This includes <em>output format enforcement</em> (asking the LLM to only output a specific format, possibly with dummy examples), <em>checking instructions</em> (prompting the LLM at end to verify if it followed all instructions/constraints), and <em>critique prompts</em> (having the LLM critique its own answer). For instance, explain how to prompt the agent with something like: "Before finalizing, ensure the solution is correct and follows all steps. If not, revise." These patterns tie into upcoming lectures on self-refinement. Mention that advanced prompt engineering goes beyond clever wording – it's about <strong>systematic structure</strong>. Cite how an AI PM's prompt architecture included sections like Role, Context, Instructions, Output format, and Guardrails within the prompt, illustrating a systematic approach.

                <li>
                    <span class="time-block">02:00 – 02:30</span>
                    <strong>Few-Shot Demonstrations & In-Context Learning:</strong> Discuss when and how to include examples in prompts to guide agent behavior. E.g., providing an example of a tool use turn (user asks X, agent thought Y, took action Z) in the prompt can prime the agent to mimic that process. Warn about prompt length limits – balancing giving enough demonstrations vs. context window issues. Also cover <em>dynamic prompting</em>: techniques such as retrieving relevant examples from a database (e.g. using a similarity search on past successful agent traces) to insert into the prompt at runtime for better performance.

                <li>
                    <span class="time-block">02:30 – 03:00</span>
                    <strong>Hands-on Prompt Design:</strong> Walk through designing a prompt for a mini-agent step by step. For example, build a prompt for an agent that uses a calculator tool to solve math problems. Start with a naive prompt and identify weaknesses (the agent might forget to show its reasoning or format incorrectly). Iteratively refine the prompt using techniques from this lecture (add CoT instruction, specify an output schema for actions, add a few-shot example of tool use, etc.). Show the improvement in the agent's responses after each prompt modification. End with Q&A, reinforcing that <strong>prompt engineering for agents</strong> is an iterative, empirical process requiring careful thought and testing, as it lays the groundwork for the agent's reasoning and actions.

                    <strong>Integrating Reasoning with Acting – ReAct Paradigm:</strong> Introduce the ReAct framework (Reasoning and Acting) where an agent interleaves thought and action. Explain how ReAct allows an LLM to decide when to use a tool by reasoning about the user query and facts. Show a simple ReAct example: the agent's thought: "I need more information about X, I should use the search tool," then the tool action, then observation, then next thought. By walking through a ReAct chain, illustrate how the agent can dynamically plan a sequence of tool calls and ultimately produce an answer. Emphasize that ReAct was a breakthrough prompting strategy that synergizes chain-of-thought with tool use, enabling more complex tasks than either alone.

                    <strong>Planning Algorithms and Search:</strong> Move beyond reactive loops to explicit planning. Discuss how an agent can first plan a multi-step solution then execute it. Introduce the concept of <strong>plan-and-execute</strong> vs. <strong>interleaved planning</strong>. For instance, an agent might generate a full plan (as text or a structural form) then carry it out step by step. Compare this to ReAct (which plans stepwise). Mention research like <em>Language Model Planner</em> or even AI planning algorithms integrated with LLMs (e.g., a tree search over possible actions or use of classical planners guided by LLM). Also introduce <em>State management</em>: how the agent tracks what it has done or still needs to do (simple agents rely on the prompt history, advanced ones maintain an explicit task list). Outline how planning becomes crucial for <strong>long-horizon tasks</strong> (where many steps are needed) and how it helps avoid getting stuck or looping.

                    <strong>Tool Use Strategies:</strong> Dive into how agents decide which tool to use and when. Cover the importance of tool selection: an agent may have multiple tools (search, calculator, database query, etc.), so how does it pick? Discuss strategies like including a "tool description" in the prompt (so the LLM knows each tool's purpose) and using the LLM to classify the user request or the current subtask (akin to the <em>LLM as router</em> pattern). Explain that some frameworks have the agent propose an action and the system will execute it if it matches a known tool; if not, the agent could be forced to try again. This segment essentially covers how reasoning and planning are directed toward <strong>action decisions</strong> – linking Lecture 2's focus on prompting to concrete decision-making.

                    <strong>Error Handling and Recovery:</strong> Discuss how agents handle reasoning failures or dead-ends. In a planning context, what if a step fails (e.g., a tool returns no result or an error)? Introduce <em>exception handling</em> in agents – e.g., agents can be prompted or coded to try an alternative approach if a tool's outcome is not satisfactory. Mention the concept of <em>retry limits and guardrails</em> to avoid infinite loops or repetitive failures. For example, an agent might loop asking the same question – implementing a guardrail like "if the agent has repeated an action 3 times, stop or escalate to human" improves reliability. Tie this to reasoning: agents might also reflect on why an approach failed (some advanced agents use an LLM to analyze a mistake and suggest a fix – a form of meta-reasoning).

                    <strong>Case Study – Complex Task Walkthrough:</strong> Present a detailed walkthrough of an agent solving a complex problem (e.g., a medical diagnosis or a coding task) requiring multiple reasoning steps and tool uses. Break down the solution: first, the agent plans or starts with ReAct, then uses tools in a sequence, encountering perhaps a point where it must revise its plan. Show how the agent's internal reasoning (chain-of-thought) evolves at each step. This case study consolidates how planning and acting interplay. Conclude by highlighting key takeaways: clear reasoning traces (which we see in the CoT) help debug agent decisions, and explicit planning can make long tasks tractable.

                    <strong>Research Spotlight:</strong> Summarize a couple of research advancements in agent reasoning. For example, mention <em>Tree-of-Thoughts</em> or <em>Graph-of-Thoughts</em> as advanced planning methods where the model explores multiple reasoning paths in parallel (a form of search), or <em>self-correcting LLMs</em> where the model can notice logical errors in its own reasoning (as studied in recent papers). Also note any limitations discovered (e.g., LLMs still struggle with consistent long-term planning without human-designed scaffolding). This connects the lecture's practical content with cutting-edge work, preparing students for deeper dives in later lectures on learning and self-improvement.

                    <strong>Agents and Tools – Interfaces:</strong> Introduce why tools are essential: even powerful LLMs have knowledge cutoffs and limited arithmetic or real-time abilities. Agents extend their capabilities by invoking external tools (APIs, databases, calculators, web browsers, code interpreters, etc.). Review how a basic agent uses a tool: it outputs a special token/command in its response which the agent system intercepts to call a function, then feeds the result back into the LLM. Discuss the simplest architecture (single-agent with tools). Emphasize how proper integration abstracts tool details away from the LLM – the LLM just needs to know the tool's <em>name and purpose</em>, not the low-level API details (the agent runtime handles that).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="time-block">00:30 – 01:00</span>
                    <strong>Model-Context Protocol (MCP):</strong> Explain MCP as an emerging standard to formalize tool usage in LLM agents. MCP provides a structured interface (often a JSON or function schema) so that LLMs can call tools in a consistent way. By standardizing how the LLM "requests" a tool and how results are returned, MCP enables more robust and modular agent design. For example, describe how an agent with an MCP layer might say: <em>ToolCall</em>: {tool: "WeatherAPI", params: {location:"Paris"}}, and the framework handles it, returning <em>ToolResult</em>: {"WeatherAPI": "sunny, 25°C"}. This abstraction means the agent's logic (reasoning about when/why to call the tool) is separated from integration details. Provide an illustration of an MCP-based workflow and how it simplifies adding new tools (just define them in the MCP server).

                    <strong>Implementing Tool Use – Best Practices:</strong> Cover practical techniques for integrating tools. This includes designing <strong>tool schemas</strong> (if using function calling APIs like OpenAI's functions or JSON-based tools) to minimize ambiguity. Talk about how to handle tool errors (e.g., if API fails or returns nothing, perhaps feed an error message back for the LLM to handle). Also, discuss <em>tool selection prompting</em>: giving the LLM a concise description of each available tool in the system prompt so it knows when to use what. Highlight best practices like limiting the number of tools exposed at once (to reduce confusion) and using <em>tool prefixes or markers</em> in prompts to clearly delineate tool-related responses.

                    <strong>Chaining Tools and Multi-step Workflows:</strong> Many tasks require multiple tools in sequence (e.g., research agent: search the web, then use calculator on found data, then compose answer). Explain how agents manage multi-step tool chains. Some frameworks allow the LLM to call one tool, get result, then decide next action, etc. This can be seen as a <strong>workflow orchestration</strong> problem. Mention approaches like <strong>StateFlow</strong> or other workflow languages for LLMs that help structure multi-tool interactions. Example: an agent booking travel might use a search tool to find flights, then a booking API – outline how the intermediate state (list of flights) is passed along.

                    <strong>Security & Safety in Tool Use:</strong> When giving agents tool access, especially powerful ones like executing code or controlling a browser, safety is critical. Discuss guardrails such as permissioning (the agent can only call approved APIs), sandboxing (for code execution tools, run in isolated environment), and monitoring tool outputs for malicious or unintended actions. Cite real instances: e.g., tools that can cause external effects (like sending an email or spending money) are often put behind explicit human confirmation steps – tie back to the <em>Human-in-the-Loop</em> pattern for high-stakes actions. Emphasize that while tools greatly extend agent capability, they also introduce new failure modes (e.g., tool might return false info, or agent might misuse a tool), so robust design and testing of tool integrations is needed.

                    <strong>Lab Demo:</strong> Demonstrate a simple agent integrated with one or two tools. For example, show a live (or pseudo-code) demo of an agent that: takes a math word problem, uses a calculator tool for arithmetic, and returns the answer with explanation. Step through the code or pseudocode highlighting where the prompt is constructed, where the agent's output is parsed for a tool call, and how the result is inserted back. If possible, also show an example of an MCP-based tool call using a standardized format. This concrete demo solidifies how all the abstract concepts (prompts, reasoning, MCP, etc.) come together in an implementation.

                    <strong>When One Agent Isn't Enough:</strong> Introduce the motivation for multi-agent systems – some problems are naturally modular or benefit from specialization (e.g., an "architect" agent that plans and "worker" agents that carry out subtasks). Discuss how multi-agent setups can mirror human teams with division of labor. Present the basic architectures from the design patterns: <strong>Supervisor (Manager-Worker)</strong> where one agent delegates tasks to others, <strong>Decentralized Network</strong> where agents communicate peer-to-peer without a single leader, and <strong>Custom structures</strong> mixing these approaches. Explain that multi-agent systems can increase capabilities (more parallelism, diverse skills) but add significant complexity, cost, and unpredictability.

                    <strong>Agent Communication Protocols:</strong> For agents to collaborate, they need to communicate. Describe common approaches: passing messages in natural language (where each agent treats the other's output as input – essentially dialogue between agents), versus structured communication (agents exchange data through a shared memory or blackboard). Many multi-agent frameworks use the simplest approach: agents prompt each other with text. Give an example of two agents in conversation: Agent A (a question-asker) and Agent B (a solver) that go back-and-forth – this was used in e.g. self-debate or reflection scenarios. Also mention the concept of <em>Agent as Tool</em>: one agent can call another agent as if it were an external tool (via a defined API), which effectively uses MCP concepts to allow one agent to leverage another's specialized skills.

                    <strong>Emergent Behaviors and Simulations:</strong> Highlight interesting research findings like <em>Generative Agents (Stanford, 2023)</em> where multiple agents with memories simulate believable social interactions (e.g., a small town simulation). This shows that with the right architecture (each agent having its own profile and goals, and an environment to interact), complex emergent behaviors can arise. Use this to illustrate both the potential and difficulty: multi-agent systems might achieve more than a single agent, but they can also go off track (unintended behaviors when agents miscommunicate or reinforce each other's errors). Tie this to the need for careful design: sometimes a single more powerful agent is easier to control than a herd of smaller agents.

                    <strong>Use Cases for Multi-Agent Systems:</strong> Discuss practical applications of multi-agent setups. Examples: <em>Software development agents</em> – one agent generates code, another tests it (akin to generator vs tester collaboration); <em>Brainstorming or creativity</em> – multiple agents representing different perspectives (optimist vs pessimist or different expert domains) to generate a well-rounded solution; <em>Negotiation or multi-party dialogue</em> – agents taking on roles in a negotiation simulation. Also mention multi-agent in robotics: multiple robotic agents coordinating (though in our context it might still be multiple LLM controllers). Emphasize that currently, multi-agent solutions are mostly experimental and used in research or limited scenarios – industry tends to favor simpler controlled flows unless there's a clear gain.

                    <strong>Challenges: Coordination and Control:</strong> Cover the challenges inherent to multi-agent systems. <strong>Coordination</strong>: ensuring agents don't talk over each other or fall into infinite loops of asking each other questions. <strong>Cost</strong>: multiple LLM calls can multiply cost and latency. <strong>Debuggability</strong>: diagnosing a failure might mean sifting through the logs of many agents across many turns. Discuss mitigation strategies: e.g., have a supervisory process that can shut down agents that are off task, or use limited rounds of interaction. Also consider <em>emergent misalignment</em>: two agents might conspire (not literally intentionally, but their interaction might lead to outputs neither alone would produce – e.g., amplifying an error). Stress that evaluation (to be covered next lecture) becomes even more critical when multiple agents are involved, to catch these issues.

                    <strong>Design Exercise:</strong> Pose a scenario to design a multi-agent solution: for instance, an "AI research assistant team" where Agent A specializes in searching literature, Agent B summarizes findings, and Agent C critiques the summaries for quality. In small groups (if applicable) or as a class discussion, outline how these agents would interact step-by-step to answer a complex research question. What protocol do they use (perhaps Agent A and B work in parallel, then C reviews)? How do they share information (common memory or message passing)? After the exercise, present a plausible design and walk through it. This consolidates understanding of how to break a task into roles and how agents can be orchestrated, reinforcing that multi-agent systems require thoughtful architectural planning to be effective.

                    <strong>Architectural Considerations:</strong> Transition from conceptual patterns to concrete architectures. Discuss how one goes from "pattern on paper" to an implemented system. Highlight the need for a <strong>strong architectural foundation</strong> – good design can matter more than using the fanciest model. Cover key decisions: single-agent vs multi-agent (already discussed), how to modularize components (separating the LLM reasoning core from tool interfaces, memory stores, etc.), and synchronous vs asynchronous design (do we allow parallel tool calls or agent actions, which complicates state?). Emphasize designing for real-world complexity: error handling, state persistence, integration with existing software systems (APIs, databases). Use a quote or reference about architecture importance: even advanced models fail if system design is poor.

                    <strong>Overview of Frameworks:</strong> Present a survey of popular frameworks and libraries for building LLM agents. For example: <strong>LangChain</strong> – provides abstractions for chains and agents, easy tool integrations; <strong>LlamaIndex</strong> – focuses on retrieval-augmented workflows; <strong>OpenAI function calling</strong> API – a low-level but straightforward way to let an LLM call functions/tools; <strong>AutoGen</strong> (by Microsoft/Autogen-AI) – which simplifies multi-agent conversations; <strong>DSPy</strong> – a framework for declaratively constructing AI workflows; <strong>Hugging Face Transformers Agents</strong> – an ecosystem for open-source agent capabilities, etc. For each, briefly describe strengths/weaknesses and typical use cases. This gives students a map of the tooling landscape for agent development.

                    <strong>Infrastructures for Agents:</strong> Discuss the supportive infrastructure needed for production-grade agents – essentially, <em>LLMOps</em> for agents. This includes <strong>observability</strong> (logging every prompt, response, tool call) to debug and improve the agent; <strong>scalability</strong> (how to handle many concurrent agent instances – e.g., containerization or serverless functions); <strong>caching and optimization</strong> (using response caches or finetuned smaller models for speed where possible); and <strong>versioning</strong> (being able to roll out new agent prompt versions or model versions and compare performance). Mention that complex agents are more like running an ensemble of services than a single ML model, so software engineering practices (CI/CD, monitoring, etc.) apply. Connect to Aakash Gupta's point that AI PMs need to understand <strong>AI observability</strong> and monitoring to maintain quality.

                    <strong>Full-Stack AI Application Considerations:</strong> Stepping out a bit, consider how an agent integrates into a user-facing application. Cover aspects like building a <strong>front-end or interface</strong> for the agent (chat UI, voice interface, etc.), and how to manage <strong>user sessions</strong> (ensuring the agent's memory is scoped per user). Discuss any special considerations for deploying agents on the web or mobile (like latency – perhaps needing to stream partial answers to seem responsive, or handle disconnections). Also talk about cost management: calling large LLMs and many tools can be expensive, so how do we optimize (maybe by using smaller models for certain tasks or only invoking expensive reasoning when necessary). Essentially, this segment ties agent design into product engineering – an agent isn't useful alone, it operates within a larger system that needs to be robust and user-friendly.

                    <strong>Example Architecture Walkthrough:</strong> Take a representative use case (e.g., an "AI travel planner agent" inside a travel website) and outline its architecture. For example: user asks travel questions on a website -> the request goes to an agent backend that orchestrates an LLM (for core reasoning), a flights API tool, a hotels database lookup, etc. Draw or describe the flow: how the front-end communicates with the agent service, how the agent service uses an agent framework to sequence LLM and tool calls, and how results flow back. Include failure modes: what if the LLM times out or returns an invalid tool name – how does the system catch and recover? This concreteness helps students see how the abstract agent ideas manifest in a real deployed system.

                    <strong>Industry Case Studies & Q/A:</strong> Summarize one or two real-world products or prototypes that use LLM agents and dissect their architecture at a high level. For instance, OpenAI's ChatGPT code interpreter (now called "Advanced Data Analysis") – an agent that runs Python code: how it likely uses an internal sandbox and an LLM controller to decide on code execution. Or take Adept's ACT-1 or Google's PALM-SayCan for robotics – how they integrate perception, LLM planning, and action execution (only conceptually). Encourage questions on how to choose the right framework or approach for a given problem. End by reinforcing the key message: building an AI agent is as much a <em>systems design</em> problem as it is a <em>model</em> problem, requiring both AI knowledge and solid software engineering.

                    <strong>The New Importance of Evals:</strong> Open with why <strong>evaluation of LLM agents</strong> is both crucial and tricky. Traditional software tests (unit tests) expect deterministic outputs, but LLM agents are non-deterministic and context-dependent. Quote industry leaders: <em>"Most overlooked skill in ML is creating evals"</em> – teams that excel at systematic evaluation have a competitive edge. Explain that <em>AI evals are being called the new unit tests</em> for AI software, serving as the backbone of quality assurance because without them, you're essentially "flying blind" on whether your agent really works.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="time-block">00:30 – 01:00</span>
                    <strong>Types of Evaluations:</strong> Break down evaluation into categories. (1) <strong>Automated evaluations</strong> – using code or heuristic checks on outputs (e.g., does the agent's JSON output parse correctly? Did it include a citation for factual answers?). (2) <strong>LLM-based evaluations</strong> – using another LLM (or the same) as a judge to score or rank the agent's output quality, or using multiple LLM votes (though caution that this can introduce bias or error). (3) <strong>Human evaluations</strong> – having humans rate the usefulness, correctness, or safety of agent behavior. Also mention <strong>user feedback</strong> as implicit eval (e.g., user clicks "thumbs down" on an answer). Introduce the notion of <strong>scenario-based evals</strong> (multi-turn test flows) vs. single-turn evals – an agent might perform fine on one-step responses but fail in a longer workflow, so you need to test end-to-end scenarios, akin to integration tests for agents.

                    <strong>Designing Good Evals:</strong> Provide best practices for creating evaluation suites. Recommend starting with <strong>real-world failure analysis</strong> – gather real conversations or tasks where the agent performed poorly, categorize the failure modes (e.g. hallucination, tool misuse, inappropriate content). Then design eval cases targeting those specific failure modes. Stress that evals should be <strong>interpretable and tied to product goals</strong> – e.g., an agent's success isn't just getting facts right, but achieving the user's goal (like solving a problem or making a useful recommendation). Talk about using metrics: success rate on tasks, factual accuracy, relevance scores, etc., but also subjective metrics like user satisfaction. Cover the importance of having a <strong>continuous evaluation</strong> pipeline – run these evals on every new model or prompt version to catch regressions.

                    <strong>Tools for Evaluation:</strong> Survey tools and frameworks emerging for evals. For instance: <strong>OpenAI Evals</strong> – an open-source framework to create and run eval scripts for LLMs; <strong>HuggingFace's TRL</strong> (for reinforcement learning but can log success metrics); or custom harnesses where you simulate dialogues. Mention any domain-specific eval harnesses (like for code agents, you run the generated code to see if it solves a problem; for web agents, simulate a browser and see if correct info was gathered). Also highlight the utility of <strong>sandbox or simulation environments</strong> for eval – e.g., a simulated user that converses with the agent to test multi-turn interaction or a fake web environment to test an agent's browsing actions without hitting real websites. The idea of using an LLM to simulate a user query or environment can generate lots of test cases cheaply (though care needed to ensure they represent real users).

                    <strong>Monitoring and Observability:</strong> Extend evaluation into runtime monitoring. Once deployed, an agent should be continuously monitored for anomalies: track distributions of responses, frequencies of tool use, errors encountered, etc. Introduce the concept of <strong>AI observability</strong> similar to traditional logging/monitoring but for LLM behavior. For example, set up alerts if the agent's apology rate goes up (could indicate it's failing more often), or if response length drops suddenly (maybe a prompt got broken). Encourage instrumentation: capturing every decision the agent makes (which can be a lot of data) and using dashboards to spot trends. This operational aspect closes the loop: evaluation isn't one-and-done, it's an ongoing process of <em>measure -> improve -> measure</em>.

                    <strong>Continuous Improvement Loop:</strong> Tie together evaluation with the development cycle. Describe a virtuous cycle: use eval results to prioritize what to fix (maybe the agent fails on a certain category of question – focus on that), implement improvements (could be prompt tweaks, adding a tool, fine-tuning), and then re-evaluate to verify improvement. Also discuss how to present eval results to stakeholders – e.g., define an "Agent Quality Score" composed of various metrics for easier tracking. If applicable, mention A/B testing with live users: sometimes you need to test two agent versions with real user traffic to see which performs better on engagement or task success (since offline evals aren't perfect proxies). Conclude by reinforcing Greg Brockman's sentiment that <strong>teams who figure out evals win</strong> – in the age of probabilistic AI, rigorous evaluation is what separates robust, trustworthy AI products from flaky demos.

                    <strong>Understanding AI Agent Risks:</strong> Outline the unique safety risks posed by autonomous LLM agents. These include <strong>content risks</strong> (the agent might produce harmful or biased output), <strong>tool misuse</strong> (agent could perform unintended actions via tools, like an agent with browsing could navigate to disallowed content or an agent with code execution could be induced to do something harmful), and <strong>hallucination with high stakes</strong> (the agent might confidently provide false information in a critical context). Emphasize that giving an LLM autonomy (especially with tools) <em>amplifies</em> certain risks, hence stronger guardrails are needed. Mention contemporary concerns: model jailbreaks (users tricking the agent into ignoring its instructions), data privacy (agent might reveal confidential info it has access to), and fairness (ensuring the agent's actions don't systematically disadvantage certain users).

                    <strong>Safety Guardrails and Policies:</strong> Discuss methods to keep agent behavior in check. One approach is using <strong>system instructions/policies</strong> – e.g., a strict system prompt that lists don'ts (like "Never provide medical advice" or "If the user requests disallowed content, refuse"). However, policies in prompt form are not foolproof (mention how adversarial prompts can break them). Thus, additional layers: <strong>content filters</strong> that scan the agent's output (and possibly input) for disallowed content (e.g., using regex or another AI classifier) and block or sanitize it. For tool use, implement permission levels: some actions require confirmation. Introduce the concept of a <strong>policy engine</strong> that intercepts agent decisions (for example, Anthropic's <em>Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP)</em> outlines rules for safe deployment). Also bring up the <strong>Guardrails library</strong> (open-source) which allows defining outcome schemas and guard conditions to validate LLM outputs.

                    <strong>Alignment Techniques:</strong> High-level overview of how LLMs are aligned with human values and how that applies to agents. Cover <strong>RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)</strong>: models like ChatGPT were fine-tuned to follow instructions and avoid certain content via human feedback loops. For agents, alignment might mean fine-tuning an agent (or its underlying model) to handle the added responsibility of tool use safely. Also explain <strong>Constitutional AI</strong> (Anthropic's approach) where the model is guided by a set of written principles (a "constitution") to self-critique and avoid harmful behavior. This could be applied in agents: e.g., have the agent internally check "Does this action violate any rule?" using a self-reflection step based on a constitution. Another technique: <strong>AI model as a gatekeeper</strong> – for instance, use a second model that is trained to detect unsafe requests or outputs to veto the primary agent's actions.

                    <strong>Privacy and Ethical Use:</strong> Address data privacy – agents often need user data (for personalization, etc.), so ensuring compliance with privacy laws and norms is crucial (e.g., not logging sensitive data in plain text, handling deletion requests). For example, a medical agent must be HIPAA compliant: perhaps avoid storing full conversation text, or have special handling for PHI. Also consider the ethics of automation: if an agent can take actions autonomously (like financial transactions or content moderation decisions), we need transparency and possibly human accountability in the loop. This segment might involve open discussion on questions like: Should an AI agent be allowed to do X? How do we ensure an agent respects user intent and dignity? Encourage thinking about not just "can we build it" but "should we", aligning with ethical AI principles.

                    <strong>Regulatory Landscape & Future Directions:</strong> Briefly touch on how the broader world is responding – e.g., EU AI Act likely classifying certain AI agent uses as high risk requiring oversight, guidelines from bodies like NIST or ISO on AI system safety. Also mention <em>red-teaming</em> practices: before deploying, having internal teams or external auditors try to break the agent or make it misbehave, to identify weaknesses. Inspire students to think of alignment as an ongoing process: just as evals help catch functional issues, <em>adversarial testing</em> helps catch safety issues. Conclude with a reinforcement: <strong>safety is a first-class aspect of agent design</strong>, not an afterthought – robust agents have guardrails "baked in". Cite Aakash Gupta's point that any AI product requirements should document safety and bias mitigation explicitly, and core agent components must include <em>guardrails</em> for output validation and ethical boundaries.

                    <strong>Workshop – Mitigating a Risky Scenario:</strong> Present a hypothetical scenario: e.g., an AI agent that helps automate HR hiring processes (scanning resumes, recommending candidates). Ask the class to brainstorm potential ethical/safety issues (bias against certain groups, privacy of applicant data, etc.) and come up with concrete guardrails or design changes to mitigate them (for instance, ensure the agent's prompts or training don't contain biased language, have a human review stage for each recommendation, log justifications for decisions, etc.). Discuss the proposals, highlighting how principles from this lecture apply in practice. This wraps up the lecture by translating abstract alignment ideals into practical steps for building safer agent systems.

                    <span class="time-block">00:00 – 00:30</span>
                    <strong>Why Simulation and Synthetic Data:</strong> Introduce the concept of using <strong>simulated environments or synthetic data</strong> to train and improve agents. When real data is scarce or expensive (or when testing risky behaviors safely), simulation is invaluable. For example, instead of deploying an unproven agent directly to users, one can simulate user interactions (using another LLM to play the user) to generate lots of conversation data and uncover issues. Similarly, generating synthetic task scenarios can help fine-tune an agent or provide it with more examples to learn from. This ties back to evaluation too: synthetic data can populate our eval suite. Emphasize that in the LLM era, we can often have AI systems generate data for AI systems – a form of <em>bootstrapping</em> their capabilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="time-block">00:30 – 01:00</span>
                    <strong>Self-Play and Agent Simulations:</strong> Delve into techniques where an agent (or multiple agents) essentially practice with themselves. For instance, <em>self-play</em> – an agent could play both user and assistant in a conversation to create training data for better alignment. Or two agents with different goals interact (like in a game) to learn strategies. Reference any known examples: e.g., using ChatGPT to simulate a user asking tricky questions, then using that to fine-tune another agent to handle them. Also mention <em>arena simulations</em> – multiple copies of an agent tackling variations of a task, with a selection mechanism to choose the best outcome (introducing some evolutionary improvement). The key idea: simulation can expose the agent to a broad range of situations including edge cases that might be hard to get from limited real data.

                    <strong>Synthetic Data for Training (SWiRL example):</strong> Present <strong>SWiRL (Step-Wise Reinforcement Learning)</strong> as a concrete research example. Explain how SWiRL generates synthetic multi-step reasoning trajectories and then uses RL on those to improve an LLM's performance on complex tasks. The agent's own outputs (or a larger model's outputs) can be treated as pseudo-data: filtered for quality then used to fine-tune or reinforce the model. The result was significant gains on tasks like multi-step QA and math by training on these synthetic reasoning traces. This demonstrates a general approach: if your agent isn't good at a certain kind of reasoning, you might generate many examples of that reasoning (perhaps with another more capable model or by programmatic means) and use them to improve your agent.

                    <strong>Reinforcement Learning for Agents:</strong> Cover how <strong>Reinforcement Learning (RL)</strong> fits in. We've discussed RLHF for alignment; here we talk RL for skill improvement. An agent in a simulated environment can receive a reward for achieving goals, and we can use RL algorithms (policy gradient, etc.) to update it. For example, an agent that writes code could be rewarded if the code passes tests, encouraging it to generate correct code. Or an agent navigating a virtual world (text-based) could get points for reaching a goal. There are challenges: LLM action spaces are huge (so RL on raw text is hard), but recent work uses techniques like <em>reward modeling</em> and <em>online optimization</em> to fine-tune LLMs for specific behaviors. Mention that companies are exploring <em>AI feedback loops</em> where models iteratively improve themselves by evaluating their own outputs and learning from mistakes (this connects to the reflect-and-critique pattern – if that process is automated and optimized, it's a kind of RL).

                <li>
                    <span class="time-block">02:00 – 02:30</span>
                    <strong>Continuous Learning Systems:</strong> Imagine agents that get better over time in production. Discuss approaches like logging new successful strategies or user corrections and feeding them back into model updates (with appropriate validation). Also mention the idea of <em>lifelong learning</em> – an agent could keep a memory of outcomes and adjust behavior without retraining (more research-y, since most LLMs can't truly adapt weights on the fly). Cover any known attempts at agents that write and refine their own code (e.g., an agent notices it failed a task, so it modifies its own prompt or logic and tries again). The key takeaway is that the frontier is moving from static agents to agents that can <em>learn from experience</em>, narrowing the gap between AI and an autonomous human assistant that improves with practice.

                    <strong>Risks of Synthetic Approaches and Mitigations:</strong> Close with a cautionary discussion: synthetic data and self-play can inadvertently amplify biases or errors (if a model has a flaw, and we generate data from it, we might reinforce the flaw). Emphasize the need to filter and supervise synthetic data generation carefully (like SWiRL did filtering on sub-trajectories). Also, models optimizing for rewards can go awry (specify reward well, or the agent might game the system – the classic RL alignment problem). Discuss how human oversight remains important: humans should review samples of synthetic outputs, and define rewards that truly reflect desired behavior (to avoid "proxy" rewards that encourage cheating). End on an optimistic note that combining simulation and human feedback is powerful – e.g., use simulation to cover breadth and humans to ensure quality. This lecture should leave students with insight into how the next generation of agents might not just be built – but <strong>trained</strong> – using novel data and feedback loops beyond supervised learning.

                    <strong>Coding Agents:</strong> Focus on agents that write and execute code – a prime example of LLMs acting as "doers". Examples include OpenAI's Code Interpreter (which could write Python scripts to fulfill a user request) and research like <strong>SWE-Agents</strong> where an agent interacts with a software environment. Discuss why coding is a great tool for agents: code execution allows solving math, querying data, creating visualizations, etc., which extends the agent's capabilities significantly. Walk through how a coding agent works: it takes user input, generates code (often in a sandbox), runs it, then uses the output to respond. Emphasize the iterative loop: if the code fails, the agent can read the error and try to fix it – essentially the agent is debugging itself. This is a– 02:00</span>
                    <strong>Building Blocks of Agents:</strong> Identify fundamental components present across agent systems: (1) <strong>Reasoning module</strong> – the LLM's chain-of-thought to decide actions; (2) <strong>Tool/Action interface</strong> – a mechanism for the agent to call external tools or APIs (introduce the concept of an action loop: Think → Act → Observe → repeat); (3) <strong>Memory</strong> – storing context beyond a single prompt (discuss short-term vs long-term memory); (4) <strong>Stopping criteria or Controllers</strong> – limits like step count or explicit end conditions to prevent infinite loops. Explain how these components appear in simple agents (maybe implicitly within a prompt) versus explicit in complex agents (e.g., a loop in code managing the LLM's actions).

Highlight industry emphasis on robust <strong>evaluation frameworks</strong> as a key to reliable agents (AI leaders call evals "the new unit tests" for AI). Touch on emerging frameworks (LangChain, AutoGen, etc.) and standards like <strong>MCP</strong> (Model-Context Protocol) for standardized tool use, which simplifies integrating new tools into agents. This overview prepares students for deep dives into each topic in subsequent lectures.

            <strong>Towards General-Purpose Autonomous Agents:</strong>
            Discuss the vision of truly general AI agents that can perform open-ended tasks across domains—essentially the sci-fi Jarvis or an AI assistant that can learn new tasks on the fly. Evaluate current progress: highlight advances (LLMs are surprisingly general) but also gaps (reliability, longer-term planning, physical embodiment, etc.). Mention the concept of an AI operating system—agents running continuously, learning constantly, coordinating like processes on a computer. Also introduce adaptive agents that can modify their own algorithms (meta-learning) as a glimpse of the future

            <strong>Neuro-Symbolic and Hybrid Approaches:</strong>
            Explore the promise of combining neural LLM agents with symbolic reasoning or traditional software. For example, an agent can call a formal theorem prover for logic or use a knowledge graph for factual queries. These hybrid methods mitigate some weaknesses of pure LLM agents (like logical consistency or factual precision). Discuss frameworks that incorporate symbolic planners or knowledge bases alongside LLMs
